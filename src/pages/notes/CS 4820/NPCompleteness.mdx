# Graph Coloring (8.7)

Formal definition of \\(k\\)-coloring:

\\[f: V\rightarrow \{1, 2, \dots, k\}]\\]

such that every edge \\(\(u, v\)\\), \\(f(u) \neq f(v)\\)

Use cases: wire radio assignment, resource conflict prevention

## NP Complete

Certificate: a valid k-coloring of graph; check for invalid edges and nodes

## NP Hard

Reduce \\(\rightarrow\\) 3-SAT: build a graph where some 'top level' node cannot be colored if one or more of boolean vars \\(v_1, v_2, v_3\\) is false; use colors to represent true/false state (necessary to have a 'base' state too?)

# Hamiltonian Cycle

## NP Complete

certificate: ordered list of vertices, checkable in poly time

## NP Hard

Reduction to 3-SAT

We construct a graph where there are \\(2^n\\) possible hamiltonian cycles. This is done by having a start node \\(s\\) and end node \\(t\\), and multiple rows of nodes. Each row \\(P_i\\) can be traversed in either way, and each endpoint of the row are connected to the two endpoints of the next row. A row corresponds to one boolean variable assignment \\(v_i\\), and traversing the row left or right corresponds with true or false.

Given some clause like \\((v_1 \vee v_2 \vee v_3)\\), we can encode the requirement by making a 'clause fulfillment node' \\(C\\) such that for one of the boolean variable's truth conditions, this extra node \\(C\\) can be taken as a 'shortcut' by traveling in the correct direction for that row.

# Traveling Salesman

Reduction to Hamiltonian Cycle:

make edges = 1; if salesman exists, then hamiltonian exists

# Subset Sum (8.8)

Reduction to 3DM (3-dimensional matching)

let \\(n\\) be the size of \\(X, Y, Z\\), and \\(m\\) be the size of \\(T\\), the source set of triplets. Note that certain elements may repeat within this set.

For each subset of \\((x_i, y_j, z_k)\\), we encode it as a base m + 1 (to prevent overflow) number with 3n digits, with the \\(i\\)th, \\(j\\)th, \\(k\\)th digit set to 1 and the rest set to zero. We then encode the decision version of 3DM (is there a perfect matching set of size \\(k\\) such that their union covers all elements?) as the expected sum by creating a 'goal sum' of 3n digits, each value set to 1.

# Set Decision

Within a graph \\(G=(V, E)\\), a **subset of nodes \\(S\\) is independent if no two nodes in that set are joined by an edge**. The decision variant of the Independent Set problem is as follows:

  Given a graph \\(G=(V, E)\\) and an integer \\(k\\), does \\(G\\) contain an independent
  set of at least size \\(k\\)?

# Vertex Cover

For the Vertex Cover Problem, a subset \\(S\\) of some graph \\(G=(V, E)\\) is a vertex cover if every edge in \\(E\\) has at least one endpoint in \\(S\\). Here's the decision variant of the problem:

  cover of at least size \\(k\\)?
